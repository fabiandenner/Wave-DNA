## Quick Start Guide
Getting started with Wave-DNA is easy. After downloading Wave-DNA in the directory ````<path to Wave-DNA>````, define the following environment variables:
- ````WDNA_DIR```` to the directory in which Wave-DNA is located. Using bash, for instance, simply execute the command ````export WDNA_DIR=<path to Wave-DNA>```` or, even better, add this command to your bash profile.
- ````USRLIB_DIR```` to the directory in which libm.a or libm.dylib (the standard _math_ library) is located. This may, for instance, be ````/usr/lib64/```` on Linux systems or ````/usr/lib/```` on MacOS systems.
