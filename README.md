Wave-DNA is a software tool for one-dimensional and spherically-symmetric nonlinear acoustic waves in transient and spatially variable background flow fields. The motion of the background medium is accounted for by considering a convective form of the lossless Kuznetsov wave equation, derived from first principles based on perturbations of the continuity equation and the transient Bernoulli equation, which is solved using a finite-difference method. In principle, the background flow field may be obtained from analytical solutions, numerical simulations, or experimental measurements. The acronym Wave-DNA stands for "Wave Doppler effects in Nonlinear Acoustics".
